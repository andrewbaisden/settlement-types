# Settlement types app

![Settlement](/img/settlement.png 'Settlement')

Both apps are identical one version uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and the other one uses [Zedux](https://omnistac.github.io/zedux/) for state management.

## Setup

1. Download/clone this repo to your local machine
2. `cd` into the root folder for `my-app-redux` and `my-app-zedux` and then run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. use the run the command `npm run dev` inside both folders to start the applications.

FYI both apps use Next.js and they run on port 3000 so you have to run one of them on a different port like 3001. Next.js will automatically detect this and run the other one on a different port if they are running at the same time.
